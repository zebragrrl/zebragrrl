- 👋 Hi, I’m @zebragrrl

![Blue Smoke Merit Badge](https://wiki.eugenemakerspace.com/images/5/5f/Bluesmoke.png "Blue Smoke Merit Badge - Everything is going well until the exact moment that the blue smoke comes out. This badge is earned by accidentally blowing something up while working on a project. Put the wrong voltage to something, get the wires crossed, blow half the breakers in the shop while testing something? Set your project back to the stone-age? Look at the bright side: You just earned the blue smoke badge!")
